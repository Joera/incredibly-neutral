                <!-- <p>How can these decentralized technologies benefit our society? How can we create awareness around the various narratives and help us make informed decisions? First by better understanding the options and trade-offs ourselves and then by learning to communicate them to others

                    How can we bring our own passion, knowledge and experience into the mainstream?
                </p> -->

                <p>Meetups are foremost about the ineraction with other people, meeting each other, learning from each other. Each meetup will have a topic, a central question or dillemma. We start with a central introduction and then break out in smaller groups to work on a case study. At the end we come together and present our ideas and findings.</p> 
                <p>We do not expect you to come up with ground breaking solutions or brilliant start up ideas. It is foremost about listening to other perspectives and learning to better articulate your own. In time we can learn how to formulate our thoughts as a community and grow into something of a decentralized research group or think tank.</p>
                </p>
                <p>Some of us have been discussing these topics for some time. Others are new. Professionals from other sectors who want to learn more are most welcome. So are power users, as well as criticastors and sceptics. The train is running though and won't stop so be prepared to jump on. These events are not for onboarding, speculative 'alpha' or shilling.</p>

                <p>Topic ideas ((WIP):</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Credible neutrality: when do want neutrality to be human and personal and when do we want to be impersonal and technological? Does decentralization make our inevitable non-neuitrality more visible and governable or does it just hide the decisions in code and initial design choices.</li>
                    <li>Immutability vs. governance. Should rules be set in stone or be flexible. </li>
                    <li>Defining decentralization: When can a protocol or project be considered decentralized, in the contexct of law and regulation. What does it mean for youu as a consumer?.</li>
                    <li>privacy vs transparency/accountability</li>
                    <li>ownership vs custody</li>
                    <li>Network states vs coordi-nations</li>
                    <li>Value accrual. Should this be directed to users, token holders or vc's.  Can these type of tokeneconmics inform decisions of users andf token holders?</li>
                </ul>
